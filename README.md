# Machine Learning-Based Film Recovery in Nuke

A comprehensive workflow template for using Foundry Nuke with CopyCat to create custom machine learning models for **both luma and chroma recovery** in film restoration. This approach trains small, targeted models specific to each film or reel, preserving the unique characteristics of the original material.

## Overview

### What This Template Provides

Two complementary machine learning approaches for film restoration in Nuke:

**ðŸŽ¨ Chroma Recovery**
- Restores missing or faded **color information**
- Trains models to reconstruct chroma (color channels) while preserving original luma
- Essential for color-faded films, damaged color negatives, or chroma loss

**ðŸ’¡ Luma Recovery**
- Restores missing or degraded **brightness/luminance information**
- Trains models to reconstruct luma (brightness channel) while preserving existing chroma
- Essential for damaged emulsion, brightness degradation, or luma channel loss

### Why Machine Learning in Nuke?

Traditional film restoration often relies on:
- Manual color grading tools (time-consuming, subjective)
- Generic filters (don't respect film-specific characteristics)
- One-size-fits-all approaches (lose unique film traits)

**Our ML approach offers:**

1. **ðŸŽ¯ Film-Specific Models** - Each model learns the unique grain, texture, and characteristics of a specific film
2. **ðŸ”¬ Archival Integrity** - Uses ethically sourced reference material from the same film
3. **ðŸ¤– Transparent Process** - All training decisions are documented and reproducible
4. **ðŸŽ¨ Preserves Authenticity** - Maintains the original look and feel of the source material
5. **âš¡ Efficient Workflow** - Once trained, models can be applied to entire sequences

## Recovery Procedures

### ðŸŽ¨ Chroma Recovery Workflow

**When to use:** Color-faded films, chroma channel damage, color negatives with degraded color layers

**Process Overview:**
1. **Dataset Curation** - Select frames from faded source + color reference
2. **Alignment** - Precisely match reference to source
3. **CopyCat Training** - Train model to reconstruct chroma
4. **Inference & Render** - Apply to full sequence
5. **Validation** - Compare with traditional methods

**Detailed Guide:** â†’ [docs/chroma-recovery.md](docs/chroma-recovery.md)

### ðŸ’¡ Luma Recovery Workflow

**When to use:** Damaged emulsion, brightness degradation, luma channel damage, under/overexposed areas

**Process Overview:**
1. **Dataset Curation** - Select frames from damaged source + good reference
2. **Alignment** - Match brightness and contrast levels
3. **CopyCat Training** - Train model to reconstruct luma
4. **Inference & Render** - Apply to full sequence
5. **Validation** - Verify brightness and detail preservation

**Detailed Guide:** â†’ [docs/luma-recovery.md](docs/luma-recovery.md)

- Curate representative frames
- Document all training decisions

**Quality Assurance:**
- Validate against traditional methods
- Compare side-by-side results
- Log all experiments and decisions

### CopyCat Node Configuration

Key settings for successful training:
- **Dataset Quality** - Representative frame selection
- **Alignment Accuracy** - Precise source-reference matching
- **Training Parameters** - Appropriate iterations and learning rates
