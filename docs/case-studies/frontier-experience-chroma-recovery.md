## Project Details
**Source Material:** Film project
**Challenge:** Chroma degradation with severely damaged reference color
**Workflow Version:** CopyCat-based chroma recovery
**Results:** Output achieved, reference quality limitations noted

**Workflow Approach:** Processed as sequence-level, but results were suboptimal. Reference color was too damaged, and different scenes within the movie were too visually distinct for the model to generalize effectively. Should have been separated by scene at minimum. Demonstrates limitations when reference quality is poor and visual diversity is high.

**Technical Notes:** Demonstrated that reference material quality impacts sequence-level effectiveness. Scene-level separation may be needed even for correlative sequences when visual characteristics vary significantly.
