## Project Details
**Source Material:** Film project with multiple degraded elements (35mm internegative and 16mm positive print)
**Challenge:** Severe degradation requiring both spatial and chroma recovery approaches
**Workflow Version:** `CopyCat` based combined recovery workflow
**Results:** Successful spatial and chroma reconstruction with comprehensive recovery process

**Workflow Approach:** Sequence level training worked successfully. Correlative shots with consistent visual characteristics throughout the sequence allowed effective sequence wide processing. Example of when sequence level approach is appropriate for complex recovery.
