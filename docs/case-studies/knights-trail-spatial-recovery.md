## Technical Notes
This case study demonstrates spatial information recovery using multiple sources with different spatial characteristics. The process involves identifying overlapping content between sources and training a model to transfer desirable spatial qualities (resolution, grain structure, detail) from higher-quality sources to lower-quality elements.

---

## Lessons Learned
- **Multiple source utilization**: Different film elements can provide complementary spatial information
- **Overlap detection is critical**: Accurate identification of matching frames is essential for training
- **Spatial characteristic transfer**: Successfully transferred resolution and detail between sources
- **Quality homogenization**: Achieved consistent spatial quality across the entire sequence
- **Preservation of authenticity**: Maintained the original film characteristics while improving quality
