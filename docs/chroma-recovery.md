# Chroma Recovery: Building the Colour Target

![Chroma recovery overview]({{ '/images_kebab/candy-candy/candy-candy-comparison-preview.gif' | relative_url }})
*Chroma recovery comparison from Candy Candy.*

Use this branch when picture detail survives but colour has faded, shifted, or collapsed. Complete the [shared preparation and alignment stages]({{ '/start-here/' | relative_url }}) first. This page covers only the branch-specific target. Training, inference, and delivery are documented once in [Training, Inference, and Review]({{ '/training-inference-review/' | relative_url }}).

## Choose the evidence

| Reference approach | When to use it | What must be recorded |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Matched reference** | A DVD, telecine, alternate print, or other colour record shows the same frame | Edition, owner or provider, transforms, compression, crop, and alignment limits |
| **Constructed reference** | No direct colour record survives | Historical sources, creative decisions, assumptions, and the people who approved them |

A constructed reference can support a plausible interpretation, but it is not historical proof. The [case studies]({{ '/case-studies/' | relative_url }}) show both approaches.

## Build the target

The training target combines **source luminance** with **reference chroma**. This teaches colour recovery without asking the model to replace surviving source detail.

1. If necessary, apply a restrained median or debanding pass to a compressed video reference. Record it.
2. Clone the aligned reference crop onto the source so both branches use the same picture area.
3. Convert source and reference from the working space to YCbCr.
4. In a `Shuffle`, map:
   - red from Source red (`Y`);
   - green from Reference green (`Cb`);
   - blue from Reference blue (`Cr`);
   - alpha to black.
5. Convert the target from YCbCr back to the working space.
6. Clamp input and target to the expected range, remove alpha, and copy the same bounding box to both.
7. Connect the prepared source as CopyCat input and the combined image as target.

*The chroma target uses Source Y with Reference Cb and Cr.*

## Branch-specific checks

- Difference the input and target in YCbCr. Their luminance should be nearly identical.
- Confirm that the paired crops and bounding boxes match.
- Reject a frame if alignment errors could be learned as colour edges.
- During review, watch for hue drift, colour bleeding, unstable skin tones, and flicker.
- In Resolve, use the recovered render above the original with Composite Mode set to `Color` when the delivery needs explicit source-luminance protection.

## Chroma troubleshooting

| Problem | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Detail becomes softer | Verify that Source Y, not Reference Y, enters the target |
| Wrong hue or colour bleeding | Recheck the YCbCr mapping, alignment, crop, and reference transforms |
| Flicker between frames | Add representative pairs around the transition and inspect reference consistency |
| Model misses a colour family | Add well-aligned examples containing that family rather than simply extending training |
