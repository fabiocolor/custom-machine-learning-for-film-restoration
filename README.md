# Machine Learning-Based Film Recovery in Nuke

A comprehensive workflow template for using Foundry Nuke with CopyCat to create custom machine learning models for **both spatial information and chroma recovery** in film restoration. This approach trains small, targeted models specific to each film or reel, preserving the unique characteristics of the original material.

## Overview

### What This Template Provides

Two complementary machine learning approaches for film restoration in Nuke:

**ðŸŽ¨ Chroma Recovery**
- Restores missing or faded **color information**
- Trains models to reconstruct chroma (color channels) while preserving original luma
- Essential for color-faded films, damaged color negatives, or chroma loss

**ðŸ’¡ Spatial Information Recovery**
- Restores and enhances **spatial information** using multiple sources
- Trains models to transfer spatial characteristics (resolution, sharpness, grain) between sources
- Essential for homogenizing different film elements and reconstructing missing spatial data

### Why Machine Learning in Nuke?

Traditional film restoration often relies on:
- Manual color grading tools (time-consuming, subjective)
- Generic filters (don't respect film-specific characteristics)
- One-size-fits-all approaches (lose unique film traits)

**Our ML approach offers:**

1. **ðŸŽ¯ Film-Specific Models** - Each model learns the unique grain, texture, and characteristics of a specific film
2. **ðŸ”¬ Archival Integrity** - Uses ethically sourced reference material from the same film
3. **ðŸ¤– Transparent Process** - All training decisions are documented and reproducible
4. **ðŸŽ¨ Preserves Authenticity** - Maintains the original look and feel of the source material
5. **âš¡ Efficient Workflow** - Once trained, models can be applied to entire sequences

## Recovery Procedures

### ðŸŽ¨ Chroma Recovery Workflow

**When to use:** Color-faded films, chroma channel damage, color negatives with degraded color layers

**Process Overview:**
1. **Dataset Curation** - Select frames from faded source + color reference
2. **Alignment** - Precisely match reference to source
3. **CopyCat Training** - Train model to reconstruct chroma
4. **Inference & Render** - Apply to full sequence
5. **Validation** - Compare with traditional methods

**Detailed Guide:** â†’ [docs/chroma-recovery.md](docs/chroma-recovery.md)

### ðŸ’¡ Spatial Information Recovery Workflow

**When to use:** Multiple sources of same content, homogenization needs, spatial quality improvement, partial reconstruction

**Process Overview:**
1. **Source Identification** - Identify multiple sources with different spatial qualities
2. **Overlap Detection** - Find common frames between sources
3. **Dataset Curation** - Select overlapping frames for spatial transfer
4. **CopyCat Training** - Train model to transfer spatial characteristics
5. **Application & Homogenization** - Apply to sequence and validate consistency

**Detailed Guide:** â†’ [docs/luma-recovery.md](docs/luma-recovery.md)
