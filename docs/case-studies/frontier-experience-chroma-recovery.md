## Project Details
**Source Material:** Film project
**Challenge:** Chroma degradation with severely damaged reference color
**Workflow Version:** CopyCat-based chroma recovery
**Results:** Output achieved, reference quality limitations noted

**Workflow Approach:** Processed as sequence-level. Reference color quality limitations and different scenes with distinct visual characteristics challenged the model's generalization. Scene-level separation would have been appropriate. Demonstrates impact of reference quality and visual diversity on sequence-level processing.

**Technical Notes:** Demonstrated that reference material quality impacts sequence-level effectiveness. Scene-level separation may be needed even for correlative sequences when visual characteristics vary significantly.
