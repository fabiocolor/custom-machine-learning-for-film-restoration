## Project Details
**Source Material:** Film project
**Challenge:** Chroma degradation with severely damaged reference color
**Workflow Version:** `CopyCat` based chroma recovery
**Results:** Output achieved, reference quality limitations noted

**Workflow Approach:** Processed as sequence level. Reference color quality limitations and different scenes with distinct visual characteristics challenged the model's generalization. Scene level separation would have been appropriate. Demonstrates impact of reference quality and visual diversity on sequence level processing.

**Technical Notes:** Demonstrated that reference material quality impacts sequence level effectiveness. Scene level separation may be needed even for correlative sequences when visual characteristics vary significantly.
