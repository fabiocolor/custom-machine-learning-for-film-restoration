# Candy Candy Opening - 16mm Color Recovery

## Overview
Chroma recovery for the opening sequence of Candy Candy, scanned from 16mm film. This demonstration uses a previous version of the workflow and shows effective color reconstruction results while preserving the distinctive characteristics of 16mm source material.

## Technical Notes

This case study demonstrates several key aspects of the CopyCat-based chroma recovery approach:

1. **16mm Grain Preservation**: The workflow successfully maintains the characteristic grain structure of 16mm film while reconstructing missing chroma information.

2. **Training Dataset Curation**: Careful selection of representative frames ensures the model learns the full range of color and lighting conditions present in the sequence.

3. **Iterative Refinement**: The training steps visualization shows how the model progressively improves its chroma reconstruction accuracy through multiple iterations.

4. **Earlier Workflow Iteration**: While this project used a previous version of the workflow (before the current template standardization), the core principles and effective results demonstrate the robustness of the CopyCat approach.

## Lessons Learned

- **Dataset diversity is critical**: Including frames with varied lighting conditions and color palettes improves model generalization
- **16mm requires special attention**: The unique characteristics of 16mm film (grain, resolution, color response) must be respected during training and inference
- **Previous workflow versions remain valid**: While the current template offers improved organization and reproducibility, earlier iterations of the workflow produced high-quality results
