## Technical Notes
This case study demonstrates chroma recovery for severely degraded material using generation-based approaches. The project shows how ML techniques can reconstruct missing chroma information even when degradation is extensive.

## Lessons Learned
- **Severe degradation requires generation approaches**: When chroma loss is extensive, generation-based ML techniques can reconstruct missing information
- **Combined recovery strategies**: The project shows successful integration of luma and chroma recovery workflows
- **Quality validation**: Multiple comparison methods ensure accuracy of the recovery process
