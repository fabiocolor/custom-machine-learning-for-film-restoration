# Transcripts & Raw Notes (Archived)

Raw transcripts and notes used to draft the workflows. Kept for reference; not part of the core presentation set.

Source files (root-level):
- `ALIGNMENT`
- `COPYCAT TRAINING`
- `RESOLVE AND DATASET CURATION`
- `matchgrade`

Recommendation: keep these in the repo for provenance, but donâ€™t present them to audiences. The polished docs are:
- `docs/chroma-recovery.md`
- `docs/spatial-recovery.md`
- Operator quick references are included as annexes within `docs/chroma-recovery.md` and `docs/spatial-recovery.md`.
- `docs/provenance-metadata.md`
