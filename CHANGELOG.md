## [Unreleased]
### Added

- Repository `.gitignore` tailored for Nuke, CopyCat byproducts, caches, and OS files.
- Initial `CHANGELOG.md` and versioning guidance in README.

### Notes
- First tag (`v0.1.0`) will be created after QC sign‑off of the current template.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-24 (prepared)
### Added
- `WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` as the canonical end‑to‑end workflow.
- Supporting reference materials under `DOCS/` (presentations and images).
- Repository structure matching the five‑stage CopyCat workflow under `pipeline/`.

### Changed
- `README.md` aligned to the workflow and repo layout.

### Security
- Guidance to keep licensed/high‑resolution scans and CopyCat weights out of the repo; use relative mounts.
