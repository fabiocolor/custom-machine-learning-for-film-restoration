# Reference-Trained Recovery with CopyCat

This workflow trains a small neural network for one film project. It learns from carefully chosen pairs: a degraded source frame and a better reference to the same moment. The method can recover colour, or it can recover spatial detail, while keeping the surviving source material at the centre of the process.

It is intended for film archives, restoration practitioners, colourists, and researchers who have access to Foundry NukeX or Nuke Indie with CopyCat and Inference.

    <p class="card-kicker">When colour has faded</p>
    <h3>Chroma recovery</h3>
    <p>Use the source frame’s luminance and detail, then learn colour from a stronger reference such as another print, a telecine, a home-video release, or a carefully constructed guide.</p>

    <h3>Spatial recovery</h3>
    <p>Use a sharper or more complete reference to reconstruct detail while preserving the colour information that remains in the source.</p>

## The working method

1. Prepare the source and reference without creative grading.
2. Align them in time and space.
3. Select a small, representative set of trustworthy frame pairs.
4. Build a target that isolates the information being recovered.
5. Train and compare checkpoints on material the model has not seen.
6. Apply the model to the complete source and review the result shot by shot.
7. Keep the original scan, references, settings, and review notes alongside the output.
