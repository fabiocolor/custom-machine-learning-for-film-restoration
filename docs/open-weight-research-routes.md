# Open-Weight Colour Recovery: Research Routes

This work is not yet a general-purpose colour-recovery system. It is a set of connected research routes, each tested under different conditions and each carrying different levels of confidence.

The most useful public account is therefore not a list of features. It is a map of what has been demonstrated, what looks promising, and what remains unresolved.

This map is a dated research snapshot rather than a permanent ranking. Routes may be revised, combined, downgraded, or replaced as new experiments are completed and reviewed.

## Selected experiments, with context

The images below are not a gallery of finished restorations. Each one answers a narrower question. The notes explain what went into the test, what the comparison can support, and what it cannot prove. Film, model, software, and source information is collected on the [Credits & Attribution]({{ '/credits/' | relative_url }}) page.

These are selected public examples. The [SEAPAVAA 2026 companion]({{ '/seapavaa-2026-companion/' | relative_url }}) contains the larger comparison set, individual source files, prompts, and presentation media.

## Route 1 · Source-owned luminance, generated chroma

<span class="status status-demonstrated">Demonstrated foundation</span>

The current public workflow and successful temporal tests keep the source responsible for luminance, geometry, texture, and damage. The model contributes chroma. This limits the model’s authority and makes colour errors easier to review, but it does not prevent colour from crossing an edge or attaching to the wrong region.

## Route 2 · Still-frame recovery without a matched reference

<span class="status status-demonstrated">Demonstrated, bounded</span>

Tests using a faded source, source-derived edge control, a softened colour chart, and a restrained prompt have produced useful first-pass candidates without a matched colour frame. These candidates are worth human review, but they are not historically authoritative or consistently correct across subjects.

## Route 3 · One approved same-shot colour anchor

<span class="status status-promising">Promising, strongest reference-driven route</span>

When one frame in a shot has an approved colour interpretation, that frame can act as a restrained palette and material guide for neighbouring source frames. Each new frame still enters as the primary image; the anchor is not allowed to dictate pose, framing, or object layout.

The public [context-board experiment]({{ '/seapavaa-2026-companion/' | relative_url }}#slide-14) demonstrates the anchor idea on a defined sequence. It supports further controlled testing, but it does not establish general success across films, motion types, or restoration aesthetics.

## Route 4 · True paired data and reference-trained chroma recovery

<span class="status status-demonstrated">Demonstrated on paired material</span>

Where real source/reference pairs exist, a compact project-specific model can learn chroma directly rather than asking a general image model to reinterpret every frame.

The published CopyCat case studies demonstrate this route on aligned film elements, while the [Frontier preparation guide]({{ '/automated-dataset-preparation/' | relative_url }}) documents how drifting references were matched and reviewed before training. The evidence supports paired learning as a practical project-specific method; it does not establish one model or setting as a general solution for every film.

## Route 5 · Video-aware chroma generation

<span class="status status-demonstrated">Demonstrated on favourable shots</span>

Wan/VACE-style video models can see a short sequence as a temporal object rather than as unrelated stills. The most successful setup used the source video, hard source-derived edge control, and one recovered middle-frame reference, then returned generated chroma to source luminance.

Two experiments show coherent shot-level chroma on favourable low- or moderate-motion material. Other tests altered faces, clothing, objects, or geometry. On harder motion, temporal coherence sometimes stabilised the wrong interpretation.

## Route 6 · Full-resolution and tiled inference

<span class="status status-open">Open question</span>

High-resolution film scans can exceed the model’s comfortable image-editing range. Tiling can recover local detail, but it introduces seams, inconsistent colour ownership, and different interpretations of the same subject across tiles.

Some tiled tests were useful; others produced reference-content takeover or a scene assembled from incompatible local decisions. Tiling is therefore a research direction, not a recommended default.

The important next step is not simply “more pixels.” It is shared evidence across overlaps, source-bound registration, and a review method that catches tile-to-tile semantic drift.

The central open problem is temporal colour ownership: keeping an evidence-aware interpretation attached to the same face, garment, wall, tree, or object through motion and occlusion without allowing the model to redesign the film. Generated colour remains an interpretation unless historical evidence supports it, and human viewing remains the final acceptance gate.
