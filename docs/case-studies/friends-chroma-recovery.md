## Project Details

**Source Material:** Film project
**Challenge:** Faded/degraded chroma information
**Workflow Version:** CopyCat-based chroma recovery
**Results:** Successful color reconstruction with preserved detail

**Workflow Approach:** Sequence-level training worked successfully. All shots are correlative with consistent lighting and visual style, allowing effective sequence-wide model training. Demonstrates when sequence-level processing is appropriate.
