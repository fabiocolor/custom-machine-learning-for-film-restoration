## Technical Notes

This case study demonstrates a more complex chroma recovery workflow that required manual creation of color reference materials. The project involved careful color reference preparation using Photoshop tools to ensure accurate chroma reconstruction.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Manual reference creation**: Sometimes custom color references need to be created when suitable references aren't available
- **Photoshop integration**: Manual tools can complement ML-based approaches for better results
- **Reference material quality**: The quality and accuracy of reference materials directly impact chroma recovery results
- **Complex workflows**: Some projects require hybrid approaches combining manual and automated techniques
