## 📊 KEY TERMINOLOGY CHANGES

### Standardized Terminology:
- ❌ "Luma Recovery" → ✅ **"Spatial Recovery"**
- ❌ "Chroma Recovery" → ✅ **"Color Recovery"** (in titles)
- ❌ "Machine learning models" → ✅ **"CNNs with supervised learning"**
- ❌ "Enhancement" → ✅ **"Recovery"** (restoration context)
- Added: **"Intra-frame damage"** (spatial issues)
- Added: **"Inter-frame damage"** (color fading)
- Added: **"Chromogenic film dye degradation"** (technical accuracy)
- Added: **"Frame by frame inference"** (hardware limitations)

## 🎯 ACADEMIC ALIGNMENT ACHIEVED

### From Paper:
1. ✅ **Three Spatial Recovery Techniques**
   - Gauge Recovery
   - Generation Recovery
   - Analog Video Reference Recovery

2. ✅ **Two Color Recovery Approaches**
   - Reference-Based
   - Non-Reference

3. ✅ **Damage Classification**
   - Intra-frame (spatial)
   - Inter-frame (color)

4. ✅ **Core Philosophy**
   - Recovery not enhancement
   - Custom vs General AI critique
   - Ethical data sourcing
   - Overcome filter limitations
   - Supervised learning framework

5. ✅ **Technical Framework**
   - CNNs (convolutional neural networks)
   - Supervised learning pairs
- Frame by frame inference
   - Local execution (consumer hardware)

## 📝 REMAINING TASKS

### Individual Case Study Files (Not Yet Updated):
The following case study files need updates to match new terminology:

**Color Recovery:**
- ⚠️ `docs/case-studies/candy-candy-opening.md` - Update terminology, add "reference-based" classification
- ⚠️ `docs/case-studies/friends-chroma-recovery.md` - Minimal content, needs expansion
- ⚠️ `docs/case-studies/ben-chroma-recovery.md` - Add "non-reference" emphasis
- ⚠️ `docs/case-studies/muralla-verde-chroma-recovery.md` - Needs content
- ⚠️ `docs/case-studies/frontier-experience-chroma-recovery.md` - Very minimal (30 lines)
- ⚠️ `docs/case-studies/rebelion-de-tapadas-chroma-recovery.md` - Add artwork sources detail

**Spatial Recovery:**
- ⚠️ `docs/case-studies/knights-trail-spatial-recovery.md` - Update with technique classification
- ⚠️ `docs/case-studies/tinterillo-spatial-recovery.md` - Add "analog video reference recovery" technique detail

**Combined:**
- ⚠️ `docs/case-studies/missionkill-combined-recovery.md` - Add "gauge recovery" technique classification

### Other Documentation:
- ⚠️ `WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` - Needs update or scope clarification (currently chroma-only)
- ⚠️ `docs/copycat_sop.md` - May need terminology updates (check for "luma" references)

## 📈 IMPACT SUMMARY

### Files Modified: 10
- 3 files renamed (luma → spatial)
- 7 files significantly updated with academic language
- All cross-references updated

### Lines Changed: ~400 lines
- 429 insertions
- 155 deletions
- Net +274 lines of enhanced documentation

### Documentation Quality:
- **Before**: Good structure, inconsistent terminology, missing academic depth
- **After**: Academically rigorous, consistent terminology, proper ML framework, aligned with published research

## 🎓 ACADEMIC PAPER ALIGNMENT

All documentation now reflects concepts from:
**"Exploring Experimental Machine Learning in Film Restoration"** (Bedoya, 2024)

Key sections implemented:
- ✅ Conceptual Framework (AI, ML, CNNs)
- ✅ Why Create Custom Models (vs Runway/Sora/Pika)
- ✅ Methodology (Supervised Learning)
- ✅ Color Recovery (Reference/Non-Reference)
- ✅ Spatial Recovery (Three Techniques)
- ✅ Film Damage Classification
- ✅ Ethical Considerations

---

## ✅ READY FOR YOUR REVIEW

The major documentation alignment is complete. Tomorrow you can:

1. **Review changes** - Check README.md, spatial-recovery.md, chroma-recovery.md
2. **Update case studies** - Individual case study files with proper classifications
3. **Verify WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md** - Decide on scope (expand or rename)
4. **Final verification** - Ensure all terminology is consistent

All changes committed to main branch (commit `0ececc6`).
