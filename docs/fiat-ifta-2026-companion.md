<p class="fc-tip">Tap a video to play it here. The player streams from Google Drive, so it may show a lower quality than the original, especially on a slow connection. To see the detail, use “Full-size original” under each video: it downloads the original file, which you can open in your phone's or computer's video player. Under each still, the buttons open each image at full size. Large files are best downloaded on Wi-Fi. Most videos are side-by-side comparisons, so each half is smaller than the full file.</p>

  <p class="fc-slide">Slide 2</p>
  <h2 id="copycat-to-open-weight-title">From CopyCat to open-weight models</h2>
  <p>My research started with CopyCat, inside Nuke. The idea is to train a small model for each film from matching frames of two copies: the damaged scan, and a better copy of the same film that shows the result we want. That's what I presented last year in Rome, and it's still my baseline. But it needs that better copy to learn from, and it's a closed platform built for visual effects.</p>
  <p>Since then, open-weight models, the ones anyone can download and run, have become good enough for images, video and voice on a single workstation. People already use them to “restore” old photos and home movies, but almost always outside the archive. So my question is: how do we constrain them so they become useful for the work we actually need?</p>
</section>

<section class="fc-section" id="masking-versus-recovery">
  <p class="fc-slide">Slide 3</p>
  <h2 id="masking-versus-recovery-title">Masking versus recovery</h2>
  <p>Most restoration tools use spatial and temporal filters. They borrow picture from the same frame, or from the frames around it, and when there's nothing clean to copy, they interpolate. The slide shows Dry Clean in Phoenix on <em>Point Blank</em> (1967); the red marks are what it detected and removed.</p>
  <p>These tools can hide dust, scratches and flicker, and bridge two or three missing frames. But they can't bring back what is lost. If we're honest, digital restoration has always been about masking, not recovery.</p>
  <p>So AI in restoration isn't something completely new. What it gives us is a way to take on problems that weren't technically or financially possible before, working with the scan as it is. In many archives, especially in Latin America and Southeast Asia, that faded scan is the only thing left of a film.</p>

<section class="fc-section" id="the-limits">
  <p class="fc-slide">Slide 4</p>
  <h2 id="the-limits-title">The limits</h2>
  <p>As I see it, there are three main limits.</p>
  <ul class="fc-points">
    <li><strong>They weren't made for film.</strong> These models were built to create or edit born-digital images. They smooth away grain and fine detail, or invent new detail. The picture looks sharper, but it stops looking like film.</li>
    <li><strong>Resolution and length.</strong> In my tests, local video models worked at around 768 × 432 pixels and could only follow about ten seconds at a time. On the slide, Qwen Image Edit ran twice on a frame from <em>Reptilicus</em> (1961) with the same prompt: once on the whole frame (1184 × 880) and once on four tiles stitched together (2048 × 1556). Look at the lifeguard tower: the tiles keep more of the film's grain and detail, but the colour drifts between them and the seams show. Tiling helps, but it brings a new problem to solve.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost.</strong> Restoration takes a lot of iterations, and in the cloud every one costs money. That's why I work locally, but that still means hardware, time and electricity. There's no free compute, even if you own the computer.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="reference-recovery-title">Reference-based colour recovery</h2>
  <p>Let's start with what already works. A small model trains on matching pairs of frames: the faded source, and a reference that still carries the colour. That reference can be a telecine, a DVD, another print, or the original negative wherever the two overlap.</p>
  <p>The model only learns colour. Its output is combined with the luma, the brightness, of the original scan, so resolution, grain and detail stay as they were. The workflow is <a href="{{ '/chroma-recovery/' | relative_url }}">documented here</a>.</p>
  <div class="fc-missing"><p>The clip shown on slide 6 isn't included on this page. Below is another example of the same method.</p></div>

  <p class="fc-slide">Slide 7</p>
  <h2 id="synthetic-reference-title">Creating a synthetic reference</h2>
  <p>So what happens when there's no reference? You create one: an approved colour frame for each shot. I call it a synthetic reference, and I make it with Qwen Image Edit, an open-weight image model from Alibaba.</p>
  <p>My first try was to guide it with a leader lady, the woman on the calibration frames at the start of a reel. It didn't work. These models don't understand meaning the way we do, so instead of taking only the colour, the model mixed the two images and the woman ended up in the shot. I call that semantic contamination.</p>
  <p>A plain colour chart worked better, once I softly blurred it. It guides the colour without giving the model anything else to copy.</p>

  <p>Then came the prompt, which is how you talk to the model. I ran a small contest, which I called America's Next Top Machine Learning Model: dozens of prompts and hundreds of test frames, over seven rounds on seven faded films. A prompt only survived a round if eight out of ten frames were acceptable. The bottom row of the slide shows a faded frame from <em>Counter Attack</em>, a Chinese film from 1976, with three of the finalists. The winner, Clara, is the one I use most, but I use the others too, depending on the shot.</p>
  <p>From the synthetic reference I keep only the colour. The brightness still comes from the scan.</p>

  <p>Getting one convincing frame is no longer the hard part. If you just run the model 24 times a second, it doesn't work, because these models aren't deterministic: every run is a bit of a roulette. Each frame gets a slightly different interpretation, and the colour flickers.</p>
  <p>Slide 8 shows a dance scene from <em>Obsession</em> where every frame was recovered on its own. Watch the dress of the woman on the right, and the background. Each frame is a fair interpretation by itself, but together they don't agree. One good frame is a thumbnail. A restoration needs the whole shot to agree with itself. That's temporal consistency, and it was the biggest hurdle.</p>

  <h2 id="h3-controlnet-section-title">Making it faster: H3 and ControlNet</h2>
  <p>I had colour that held together, but it took far too long. At the end of July, MiniMax released H3, a video model that is very good with reference images. In one pass, it carries the approved colour through a whole section of a shot.</p>
  <p>On its own, though, H3 drifts from the picture and loses the geometry. So I had to run it in short sections and make them all agree, which meant more processing and more time. Then in August, Alibaba PAI released a ControlNet for H3. A ControlNet is a way to steer what the model does; this one feeds it the edges of every frame, which helps keep the film's own geometry and movement.</p>
  <p>I keep only the colour and put it on top of the original brightness, so the grain, the roughness, even the dirt, stay. Left on their own, these models want to change everything and make it look plasticky.</p>

  <h2 id="temporal-cbcr-section-title">The Temporal CbCr adapter</h2>
  <p>This is the idea behind my CopyCat work, taken out of Nuke so the research can run on an open platform. CbCr are the two colour channels of a video picture, kept separate from its brightness.</p>
  <p>I run H3 or TeleStyle once or twice, depending on the length of the shot, and keep only the frames that pass review. I call them teachers. They don't have to cover the whole shot, as long as their geometry lines up with the picture.</p>
  <p>A small model, with fewer than a million parameters, learns the colour of the shot from the teachers in minutes. Then it fills in the frames that have no teacher and keeps the colour steady across the whole shot. On slide 12, the first and third frames have no teacher and the second and fourth do.</p>

  <h2 id="diffusion-upscaling-section-title">Diffusion upscaling</h2>
  <p>So far, the model only adds colour and the scan keeps its own picture. But sometimes the surviving element doesn't carry enough information for a traditional restoration. Our tools borrow from the same frame or the frames around it, and when every frame is damaged, there's nothing left to borrow. Diffusion upscaling lets a video model rebuild the picture from what survives, following its structure and movement.</p>
  <p><em>El Tinterillo</em> survives only as a damaged 16mm print and a telecine that is cleaner, but soft, cropped and with the strange cadence of telecines from that time. I smoothed the 16mm with a median filter, then combined the two, with the telecine inside and the 16mm around it. That gives a rough outline to guide the geometry, but the filter also removes the fine detail. So, for how the picture should look, I made more synthetic references with ChatGPT Images. MiniMax H3, in reference mode, then uses those references, with the telecine clip for the movement, to generate each section of the shot.</p>

  <h2 id="diffusion-reconstruction-title">Diffusion reconstruction</h2>
  <p>Sometimes the picture isn't damaged, it's gone: frames missing from the only surviving element. This happens a lot with nitrate, when a decaying section was cut out so it wouldn't damage the rest of the reel.</p>
  <p>Tools like Phoenix, DIAMANT or DaVinci Resolve can bridge two or three missing frames with optical flow. Across a longer gap, the motion starts to feel wrong, because they can only interpolate what survives.</p>
  <p>In the talk, the example is a 15-frame gap in a camera negative where the sound still survives, so the gap has to be filled to keep picture and sound together. I tracked the actors from the last frame before the gap to the first frame after it, and carried that movement through the missing frames: those are the skeletons on slide 16. Then Alibaba's VACE video model generated the picture, guided by that movement, only inside the gap.</p>
  <div class="fc-limits"><p><strong>What worked, and the limits.</strong> The generated frames hold up well, and every original frame stays untouched. The resolution limit from slide 4 still applies, and what is generated has to be declared.</p></div>

  <p>When several elements survive, each one is usually damaged in different places. The George Eastman Museum sent me <em>Knight of the Trail</em> (1915) as a nitrate print and a diacetate safety copy. Together they cover most of the film, but in some places the nitrate has decayed and the safety copy is missing those frames too.</p>
  <p>First, I bring the two elements together. They had different colour, warping and framing, so each frame of one is matched to the other by its features and warped into place. Then one tone correction, fitted on the cleanest matching frames, gives both the same look.</p>
  <p>After that, each frame comes from whichever element survives undamaged: 155 frames from the nitrate print and 53 from the safety copy. The timeline on slide 18 is a map of this, with orange for the nitrate, blue for the safety copy and red where neither survives. In those 18 frames, I mask only the damaged areas, including damaged still background, and Wan VACE 14B, Alibaba's video model, reconstructs those. The surviving picture stays original, because we don't want to replace a whole frame just because part of it is damaged.</p>

  <p>The same idea applies to sound: a word that has been badly distorted can be rebuilt from the actor's own voice.</p>
  <p>I used Fish Audio S2 Pro, an open-weight speech model, running locally. It's given a few seconds of the same actor's clean dialogue from the film, about ten seconds in this case, and the exact words. It generates many takes of the whole line. Speech recognition and voice comparison help rank them, but listening decides. Then only the damaged part goes back in, about a third of a second here. Everything else is the original soundtrack.</p>

  <p>AI can also work through the tools we already use. The companies that make them are building it in, for control and management as well as processing. DaVinci Resolve 21.1 lets AI assistants operate it directly, Premiere Pro has an AI Assistant that works inside the project, and Avid has shown agentic AI for Media Composer. Restoration tools can work the same way.</p>

        <li><span class="fc-part-label">Source</span><p>A teaching copy of the Point Blank trailer project in Phoenix: a 52-frame shot, 2048 × 1556, at 24 frames per second.</p></li>
        <li><span class="fc-part-label">Two renders</span><p>The shot was exported twice from Phoenix: once without Dry Clean and once with it.</p></li>
        <li><span class="fc-part-label">What Dry Clean changed</span><p>The difference between the two renders shows what Dry Clean changed. Changes larger than 8 code values were grouped into separate marks.</p></li>
        <li><span class="fc-part-label">The model</span><p>A small image classifier (ResNet18), trained on brush strokes from another film, looked at each mark with the frames before and after it and predicted whether to bring the original picture back there.</p></li>
        <li><span class="fc-part-label">Into the project</span><p>Its choices became Matte Paint brush strokes: 630 over the 52 frames, written into the Phoenix project and read back to check them.</p></li>
        <li><span class="fc-part-label">Review</span><p>The recording is Phoenix playing the result with Red Difference on. In review, it also brought back wall areas where no meaningful information was lost, so it isn't accepted yet.</p></li>

  <h2 id="limits-now-title">Where the limits are now</h2>
  <ul class="fc-points">
    <li>What has worked best is keeping the film's own picture and letting the model add only what is missing: the colour, a gap, a word.</li>
    <li>Colour holds through a shot when approved references guide the whole shot, either through a video model or through the small adapter.</li>
    <li>Control helps the most. Edges, tracked movement and registration keep the model on the film, not on its own idea of it.</li>
    <li>In the colour workflow, a small model learns from approved teacher frames and fills in the shot, so the big model doesn't have to run on every frame.</li>
    <li>What still needs to improve is resolution and length. The models still see a reduced picture, about ten seconds at a time.</li>
    <li>None of it is one click. It takes patience, and a restorer to decide what is acceptable and to say what was generated.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A year ago, even a couple of months ago, none of this was possible.</p>
